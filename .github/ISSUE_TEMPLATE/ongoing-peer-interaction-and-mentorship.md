- **Scheduled Checkpoints: BEFORE**
	- Every few days (or weekly), demonstrate your current progress to at least one peer.
	- Let them run or compile your library and provide immediate feedback.
- **Pair Programming / Group Debugging: WHILE TASK OPEN**
	- Don’t hesitate to set up small groups to solve tricky bugs together.
	- Offer to help your peers similarly. This reciprocal help cements your learning.
- **Mini Presentations: AFTER **
	- If you discover a cool technique (e.g., a better file-reading strategy), **offer a brief “micro talk”** in the cluster.
	- Encourage others to do the same, reinforcing a community of shared learning.
